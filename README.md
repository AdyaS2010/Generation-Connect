# GenerationConnect

> Bridging the digital divide, one conversation at a time.

**GenerationConnect** is an open-source, cross-platform mobile application that creates meaningful intergenerational connections by pairing tech-savvy students with seniors who need technology assistance. Built with passion by three high school students who believe that technology should bring people together, not apart.

## The Idea üí°üí°

We noticed something heartbreaking: while younger generations grow up fluent in technology, our seniors often feel left behind and isolated in an increasingly digital world. At the same time, students need community service hours but struggle to find meaningful ways to give back.

**Generation Connect solves both problems.**

This isn't just an app; we created our solution with purpose, designed as a tractionable movement. We're creating a platform where:
- üëµ **Seniors** get patient, personalized tech help from young people who genuinely care
- üéì **Students** may earn community service hours, while developing empathy and real-world teaching skills
- ü§ù **Communities** grow stronger through cross-generational friendships
- üåç **Society** becomes more inclusive and connected

## üöÄ Getting Started (Foolproof Setup)

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- **Node.js** (v18 or later) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**
- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/generation-connect.git
cd generation-connect
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
npm install -g expo-cli
```

**What this does**: Downloads all required packages and installs Expo's command-line tools globally.

### Step 3: Set Up Your Supabase Project

1. **Create a free Supabase account** at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. **Create a new project** - Choose a name, database password, and region
3. **Wait 2 minutes** for your database to spin up (grab a coffee!)
4. **Find your project credentials**:
   - Go to Project Settings ‚Üí API
   - Copy your `Project URL` (looks like `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - Copy your `anon/public` key (starts with `eyJ...`)

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Create the file
touch .env

# Open it in your editor
code .env  # or: nano .env
```

Add your Supabase credentials:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Replace `your-project-id` and `your-anon-key-here` with your actual credentials from Step 3!

### Step 5: Set Up the Database Schema

The migrations are already written! Apply them in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to **SQL Editor** in your Supabase project
2. Create a new query
3. Copy the contents of each migration file from `supabase/migrations/` (in chronological order)
4. Execute each migration
5. Or use the Supabase CLI:

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref your-project-id

# Push all migrations
supabase db push
```

### Step 6: Create Your First Admin Account

Run the admin account creation script:

```bash
node scripts/create-admin-account.js
```

Follow the prompts to create an admin user. You'll need this to:
- Approve student volunteers
- Manage support tickets
- Monitor platform health

### Step 7: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
npx expo start
```

**What you'll see**:
- A QR code in your terminal
- A browser window opens with the Expo DevTools
- Options to run on iOS simulator, Android emulator, or web browser

### Step 8: Choose Your Platform

#### üì± Run on Your Phone (Recommended for Testing!)
1. Install **Expo Go** from the App Store (iOS) or Play Store (Android)
2. Scan the QR code with your phone's camera (iOS) or Expo Go app (Android)
3. The app will load on your device in seconds!

#### üíª Run in Web Browser
- Press `w` in the terminal where `expo start` is running
- Or click "Run in web browser" in Expo DevTools

#### üì≤ Run on Simulator/Emulator
- **iOS**: Press `i` (requires macOS with Xcode)
- **Android**: Press `a` (requires Android Studio)

### Step 9: Create Test Accounts

1. **Sign up as a Senior**: Test the help request flow
2. **Sign up as a Student**: Try claiming a request and scheduling a session
3. **Log in as Admin**: Approve the student and explore admin features
